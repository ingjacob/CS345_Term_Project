Fewer folds may result in less reliable estimates.\r\n",

    "The SVM or Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is typically used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to separate data points into two distinct classes. In SVM, the algorithm finds the optimal hyperplane that separates the data points of different classes. In a two-dimensional space, this hyperplane is a line, while in higher dimensions, it becomes a plane or a hyperplane\n",

    "\n",
    "- C Parameter: The C parameter is a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error. A large value of C aims to classify all training examples correctly, which might lead to overfitting. Conversely, a small value of C allows for a larger margin, potentially at the cost of some misclassifications, which may result in under fitting.\n",
    "- Gamma Parameter: In the RBF kernel, the gamma parameter defines the influence of a single training example. A low gamma value means a large influence (far-reaching), resulting in a smoother decision boundary. A high gamma value means a small influence (close), leading to a more complex decision boundary that can adapt to the training data but may result in over fitting.\n",

If the other classifiers can not perform better than the random classifer they are underperforming and not estimating results. Naive classifiers give a minimum performance threshold. If your sophisticated model can't outperform a naive approach, it indicates that the model might be overfitting or underfitting.
