    "The topic we wish to address with this project is Music Genre Classification. Since machine learning models specialize in extracting information from highly dimensional data, we believe that music data presents a strong opportunity. Since a song’s genre is one of the most defining aspects of a song, this classification is very well suited for machine learning. A genre is determined by many aspects such as the tempo, rhythm, instrumentation, and overall tone. \n",
    "\n",
    "This topic is interesting because music is an expression of emotion and a work of art. Many people prefer certain music genres because of how the songs impact their emotions. The idea of transforming songs into a collection of data points and accurately classifying them into genres is intriguing. This topic will also be challenging because audio data is very complex. Our models will have to find patterns hidden within the noise and complexity. "
